-Super secure identification system.
-We need to know who is who so that the votes can be trusted.
-This can be packaged in the form of a regular cms like wordpress, where you simply install it and bam, you have a community
-We have to make sure the project scales in a very simple way: you simply launch more server instances in order to serve more users
-FB (and other networks) Connect

-Upon action professional search will be possible.
-For example lets that the group decided to make a wooden house on a tree. Then it would be possible to find the local wood crafters, local shops to buy nails, local builders etc...
