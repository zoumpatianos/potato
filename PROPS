Eleftherios
-----------

-Consensus based voting system from 2 to many users.
-Proposals, voting, antiproposals, voting, actions.
-But also other hierarchical/non-democratic systems will be possible.
-Create a workload-related metric similar to git shortlog -ns.

Alexandros
---------
-Super secure identification system.
-We need to know who is who so that the votes can be trusted.
-This can be packaged in the form of a regular cms like wordpress, where you simply install it and bam, you have a community
-We have to make sure the project scales in a very simple way: you simply launch more server instances in order to serve more users
-FB (and other networks) Connect
-Reddit-like suggestions voting system - for voting schemes where not all voting options are pre-defined. This is a cool way 
to discover new solutions as users can vote up or down for some good suggestions. This way, the most favorite
suggestions will "float" on the top of the suggestions list
        

Dimitrios
---------
-Upon action professional search will be possible.
-For example lets that the group decided to make a wooden house on a tree. Then it would be possible to find the local wood crafters, local shops to buy nails, local builders etc...






Architecture:
----------------------------------------------------------
We must decide what language to develop the project in. 
We must keep in mind that this project will be used by communities that might not necessarily 
include tech-savy people. So:
It would be better if done in only one language for easier installations.

1. PHP
    Pros:
      * Well documented and wide-spread (see almost every other cms in the market)
      * easier to install a php system 
      * there are many ready-made solutions out there to make a php system scalable
      * most web servers support php-mysql architectures so it will be easy for smaller communities to find
a cheap (or even free) hosting solution where they can deploy our system



TODO-List
---------
- Create possible scenarios. e.g. a group of friends wants to decide which movie they want to see
- Create a mailing list (Eleftherios) Done!



Voting Scheme Parameters
------------------------
- Suggestions:
    * Predefined Suggestions
    * Open suggestions (users can insert new suggestions in the voting scheme in a Reddit fashion)
- Identification Policy:
    * Open (e.g. ip based, cookie based)
    * E-mail or Facebook or GoogleID
    * Strict Verification (based on some physical ID like: Credit Card Number, ID card, Driver's License, Face Photo, Voice etc...)
