Consensus based voting system from 2 to many users.
Proposals, voting, antiproposals, voting, actions.
But also other hierarchical/non-democratic systems will be possible.


Alexander
---------
Super secure identification system
We need to know who is who so that the votes can be trusted.


Dimitrios
---------
Upon action professional search will be possible.
For example lets that the group decided to make a wooden house on a tree. Then it would be possible to find the local wood crafters, local shops to buy nails, local builders etc...
